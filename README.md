# Moments APP
### This project is a semestral assesment in the University of Prishtina and the goal of it was to familiarize ourselves with the IOS mobile development 
<br />
The app is developed using the MVVM architectural pattern, xcode version 13.3.1, and SQLite from [this repository](https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift) and is compatible with IOS 16+ 
<br>    
<br>  

  
### Goal
The goal of this project is to make a light weight app that people would use if they wanted to store 
memories of their pictures, and occasionally scroll through them to invoke the nostalgia about good times, 
remember their family, friends, etc.


### Features

The app contains two views.  
 
First one (starting one) offers the user an overall 
view of all the moments that they've created, the ability 
to add a new one with the button on the navigation bar, edit
a moment by taping the wanting cell, or sliding the cell
to delete.      <br />

The second view offers the user 3 labels in order to
enter the name, description, date, and pick a picture of their
choosing.
